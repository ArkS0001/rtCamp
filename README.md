WordPress comes with a powerful REST API that allows you to interact with your site data in a secure and flexible way. Here’s a guide on how to develop a simple custom API endpoint in WordPress.
Step-by-Step Guide to Developing a Custom API in WordPress
1. Set Up a Plugin

First, create a plugin to encapsulate your custom API logic.

Create a Plugin Folder and File:

    Navigate to wp-content/plugins/.
    Create a new folder named custom-api.
    Inside this folder, create a file named custom-api.php.

Add Plugin Header:

php

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Custom API Plugin
Description: A plugin to create custom REST API endpoints.
Version: 1.0
Author: Your Name
*/

if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
    exit; // Exit if accessed directly.
}
?>

2. Register a Custom Endpoint

Use the register_rest_route function to add a custom endpoint. Add this code inside your custom-api.php file:

php

<?php
// Plugin Header

add_action( 'rest_api_init', function () {
    register_rest_route( 'custom/v1', '/data/', array(
        'methods' => 'GET',
        'callback' => 'custom_api_get_data',
    ) );
} );

function custom_api_get_data( $request ) {
    $data = array(
        'message' => 'Hello, this is your custom API response!',
        'data' => array(
            'field1' => 'value1',
            'field2' => 'value2'
        )
    );

    return new WP_REST_Response( $data, 200 );
}
?>

This code registers a new REST API endpoint at yourdomain.com/wp-json/custom/v1/data/ which responds with some sample data.
3. Add Parameters and Authentication (Optional)

To handle parameters and ensure secure access, you can extend your API callback function.

Handle Parameters:

php

function custom_api_get_data( $request ) {
    $param = $request->get_param( 'param' );

    $data = array(
        'message' => 'Hello, this is your custom API response!',
        'param' => $param,
        'data' => array(
            'field1' => 'value1',
            'field2' => 'value2'
        )
    );

    return new WP_REST_Response( $data, 200 );
}

Add Authentication:

To restrict access, you can use WordPress's authentication mechanisms. Here’s how to check if the user is logged in:

php

function custom_api_get_data( $request ) {
    if ( ! is_user_logged_in() ) {
        return new WP_Error( 'rest_forbidden', esc_html__( 'You cannot access this resource.' ), array( 'status' => 401 ) );
    }

    $param = $request->get_param( 'param' );

    $data = array(
        'message' => 'Hello, this is your custom API response!',
        'param' => $param,
        'data' => array(
            'field1' => 'value1',
            'field2' => 'value2'
        )
    );

    return new WP_REST_Response( $data, 200 );
}

4. Test Your Endpoint

You can test your API endpoint using tools like Postman or directly in your browser. Navigate to yourdomain.com/wp-json/custom/v1/data/ to see the response.
Summary

    Create a Plugin: Set up a new plugin to encapsulate your API logic.
    Register Endpoint: Use register_rest_route to add a custom endpoint.
    Handle Requests: Define the callback function to process requests and return data.
    Test Endpoint: Use tools like Postman to test your new API endpoint.

By following these steps, you can extend the functionality of your WordPress site with custom REST API endpoints, enabling better integration with other systems and services.
